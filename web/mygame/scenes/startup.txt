"Copy. We're outisde of the compound. There doesn't appear to be too much security."

The voice from the other side replies:
"I don't much care how you do it, just make sure you take -Zian Current-, the terrorist calling himself Circuit Breaker, into custody. Of course, I wouldn't mind taking a break from fabricating cover stories for out-of-control fire fights."

You turn to your team to plan an attack when suddenlty a bullet strikes the shoulder of the member next to you. You quickly instruct your unit to fire back and make their way into the structure.

As your team advances, you notice one of the guards open a pipe cover and escape inside. Your teams seems to have the advance mostly under control.
