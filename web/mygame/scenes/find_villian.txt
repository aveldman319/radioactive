	You run for the pipe as you relay to your team your pursuit. A conformation reply returns from a member. You run up to the pipe stopping right before the entrance to gain your composure. Before disappearing into the pipe, you glimse one of your operatives fall dead on the ground. Clearing what you can see, you take a second to mourn -operative's- loss then proceed to discreetly stride down the pipeline.

	Focusing back on the mission, you run through the compound's schematics again in your head trying to determine the gaurd's most likely route. Not long into your pusuit, you begin to hear footsteps running up ahead. You chase behind the sound of steps making sure to add as little of your own as possible. The footsteps come to a hault around the corner. 

	You stop behind the corner still out of sight. You hear the gaurd talking on a radio:
	*choice
		#Fire at the gaurd.
			*set stealth - 1
			Over the radio you hear:
			*line_break
			"Were you followed?"

			The gaurd turns around to check just as you turn the corner to take aim.

			You fire and miss the gaurd who bolts down the left pipe to get away.

		#Listen in.
			*set stealth + 1
			*set stealthAbility + 1
			You  to the conversation. Over the radio you hear:
			*line_break
			"Were you followed?"

			The gaurd turns around to check and sees nothing.
			*line_break
			"No sir, I wasn't."

			The radio replies:
			*line_break
			"Good. Keep it that way! Now, take the right pipe and hurry up! The intruders are advancing quicker than expected! I don't have much time!"

			The gaurd puts his radio back on his belt. Noticing an opportunity, you sneak up behind the guard and engage him in a knock out hold. After a minor struggle, the gaurd goes limp and you drag his body a little down the left pipe in an attempt to hide it.

			You go to leave down the right pipe when you get the sudden feeling something in you has changed. Instantly you're reminded of the first time you had this feeling, back when you were inoculated with ${serum} just under a year ago. Going off half a hunch and a shred of curiousity, you act on the urge to touch the gaurd.

			Immediately you notice your hand match his skin color. Within seconds, you feel your body morphing. You let go of the guard after the experience is over, grab his metal tag, quickly polish it, and peer in to grab your reflection. To your surprise, you look exactly like him. You quickly grab his overgarments and run down the right pipe.

			As you go, you get the feeling you can't hold this form for long.
